<h1>The Daily Estrange Email being so predictable is a major security risk.</h1>

  WARNING: The following article is not true. It is in fact, very far from the truth.

  Just in from lunch: The Daily Estrange Email being so predictable turns out to be a major security risk! 
  As Isaiah Day proved, all one has to do is change their profile picture to a sheep, and they fool everyone. 
  “We may have to make the emails more interesting to stop fake emails from being distributed”, 
  says Jude when asked on the matter, “but then we run the risk of making our readers intruiged, 
  which we obviously can’t have. It’s a hard ballance between staying unpredictable and still boring the reader.” 
  As the Estrange Government considers how to keep boring the reader without false information spreading, 
  the people are crying out. “It’s just too much!” says an anoumunus citizen. “We want to be bored, 
  and these new fake emails are spreading actually interesting information all over the place! 
  Soon we may need to, although we all hate it, check the sender’s email instead of just looking at their profile picture.”
  Although the oligarchs haven’t found a solution yet, they soon will to, or the people may rebell
