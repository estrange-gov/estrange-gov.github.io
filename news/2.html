<h1>Grumbling among Populace over Owen's Campaign</h1>
<p>
Owen McCutcheon, 7 month representative of the people, may have some trouble winning this month’s election. 
New candidates, such as Toren and Julian have arised and are slowly winning the people’s vote in the upcoming election.
Owen says that he is “extremely worried” about the turnout. He has right to be nervous, as he’s no longer Sir Dictator’s top choice, 
having been replaced with Toren after they announced that they agreed with the right to arm bears.
Multiple citizens, including high ranking officials, have said that they were dissatisfied with Owen’s job performance.
Owen’s motto is “a fair choice”, which by the populace has become known as “a fair choice, but we can do better”. He makes no campaign promises, 
but says he will “keep to the people’s opinion”, which comes across to the voters as blatant lies to closed ears.
As the election nears, Max has had a unique idea: AI generated armed bears. Using online generators such as Stable Diffusion or Craiyon, 
Max and Isaiah have been busy constructing an army of armed bears to fight for Julian. It’s still unclear what Julian plans to do with this army, 
but with an interview with Max and hopefully a campaign statement from Julian, we’ll soon know for sure.
